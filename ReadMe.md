# Implementation for Common Workflow Language, v1.0. 
A project to create a portable and reproducible Common Workflow Language (CWL) [implementation ](http://www.commonwl.org/#Implementations "List of CWL Implementations"). We'll create a runner for CWl's command line tool, then improve it to run CWL's workflows.
